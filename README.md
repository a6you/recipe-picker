# recipe-picker
As amateur cooks, we don't often know what ingredients to use for many recipes, and this results in lost time trying to find and learn recipes. This lead to us getting inspired to have a web application to assist with this.

Our plan was to allow a user to enter ingredients they have in their fridge or pantry, and then fetch data from online and tell the user what recipes he/she can make with the available ingredients. If there aren't enough available ingredients, the application would tell the user where to buy those ingredients.

We faced a large challenge, as none of our group members had strong skills in coding or web development. As a team, we resolved to each do one component of the project- two people ended up working on the website aspect, and two ended up working on the back-end algorithm for comparing ingredients to a database of recipes.
